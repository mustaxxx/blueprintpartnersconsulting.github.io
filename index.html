          <p>At Blueprint Partners Consulting Limited ("BPC", “we”, “us” or “our”) we are committed to safeguarding and preserving the privacy of our clients. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

<p>For the purpose of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and complementary UK legislation, we are the data controller for any personal information gathered by this website or by other sources. Our registered address is Blueprint Partners Consulting Limited, 299a Bethnal Green Road, London, England, E2 6AH, Company registration number: 0710949730. We do update this Policy from time to time so please do review this Policy regularly.

<h4>How we collect and use information</h4>

<p>We may collect and process data about you for the following reasons:</p>

<p>Visitors to the website – if you visit our websites or landing pages we, the third party that runs the website on our behalf, and a third-party analytics service, may collect information relating to your visit including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, and the resources that you access. The analytics information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow the analytics service provider to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. Please also see our Terms and Conditions and our Cookies Disclaimer for further information about the use of the website.</p>

<p>We will process personal financial data if you make payments from a personal account (rather than a business account). If payment is taken using a personal credit or debit card, then our bank(s), the provider(s) of the card payment device, will also process your data. </p>

<p>If you do join our mailing list and subsequently decide that you would like to be removed, you can unsubscribe by emailing us at info@blueprintpartnersconsulting.com.</p>

<p>People we do business with – we hold personal data in respect of persons with whom we have business relationships, or potential business relationships. This data is typically limited to basic personal information such as name, email address, telephone number, as well as details related to the nature of the business relationship. Information is processed in accordance with any contractual agreement in place or in the legitimate interests of our business activities.</p>

<p>Our staff – we hold personal data in respect of our employees, directors, contractors and other persons who work with us from time-to-time. We have a separate privacy policy for our staff. If a person wishing to work with us sends us their details, for example through a recruitment process, we will do our best to gain their consent to hold onto their details for future roles with us, or, we will aim to delete the records once the recruitment process has concluded, although it may not be possible to remove all personal details; for example, it may not be possible to remove all references to a person’s name in our internal email system.</p>
<h4>Lawful basis for processing</h4>

<p>Under the GDPR there must be a lawful basis for processing your personal data. As outlined above, we will only do so for the purpose of running our business, to provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services, to fulfil contractual obligations, or to provide information to interested parties making reasonable enquiries. In terms of the GDPR, we will be processing either on the lawful basis of fulfilling a contractual obligation, or the lawful basis of being in the legitimate interests of our business or customers. Finally, we may process on the lawful basis of fulfilling a legal obligation if this is applicable.</p>

<p>We also process your personal data on the lawful basis of consent where you have opted to receive information about future events at BPC. You may withdraw this consent at any time by unsubscribing from our mailing list as described above. We do not ever sell or pass personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, we also rely on the lawful basis of consent if you apply for a job at BPC and agree for us to retain your details for potential future positions.</p>

<p>We never give your details to third parties to use your data to enable them to provide you with information regarding unrelated goods or services.</p>

<h4>Who we do share information with</h4>

<p>We will only share your personal data with other third parties where it is necessary for the purposes outlined above and in accordance with the relevant lawful basis for processing. Examples of the third parties that may process personal data on our behalf are: our professional advisers, our auditors, the companies that help us administer this website and any payment taken on it, organisations that provide other services that are required in the provision of our services to you. Third parties that process data on our behalf are also subject to all of the requirements of the GDPR and owe us a contractual obligation to only use your personal data for the applicable purpose and to keep your data secure.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our staff, customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

<h4>How information is kept secure</h4>

<p>We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Where personal data is held electronically we store information on our secure servers and employ security procedures and features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect personal data in our possession, we cannot guarantee the security of data when being transmitted; any transmission of your personal data to us at our site or via email or other transmission method is at your own risk.</p>

<p>On occasion we include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy before sending them any personal data.</p>
<h4>Transfers of data outside of the EEA</h4>

<p>Personal data that we collect from you will only be transferred to or stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers if the organisation or country has data protection measures that have been deemed equivalent to those in the EEA or if we have put adequate safeguards in place to ensure equivalent treatment of your personal data. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing for the purpose indicated, provided one of the conditions above is met.</p>

<h4>Your individual rights</h4>

<p>The GDPR gives you rights in respect of your personal data.</p>

<p>We would draw your attention to the following procedures that we have in place in respect of your rights:</p>

<p>Right to access – you may request that we provide you with confirmation on whether we are processing your data and, if applicable, a copy of your personal data (not personal data in respect of any other individual) and other relevant processing information such as that provided in this privacy notice.

<p>Right to erasure – you may request that personal data that we hold on you be deleted, however, we are only obliged to erase your data if we no longer have a lawful basis for processing it. Please email the contact address below providing the reason for your request and sufficient detail to accurately identify your records, and we will write to you to let you know the action we have taken.</p>

<p>Right to object – you may object to the processing of your personal data. You must give specific reasons for your objection and we are not obliged to comply with your request if we have a compelling reason to continue processing your personal data in accordance with a lawful basis. Please email the contact address below and we will write to you to let you know the action we have taken. If we do not agree with your objection we will explain why and, if you wish, how you may raise a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
